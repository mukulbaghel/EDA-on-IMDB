I, Mukul Baghel(AP21110011132), a student of Bachelors of Technology, Semester III write this application to state that I am falling short of attendance for this semester. My attendance is less than 80% at the end of December. Sir, I had met with an accident and got the ankle bone of my right foot fractured. I was advised not to put strain on the foot for three weeks. As my attendance is below 80%, I will not be allowed to sit in the exam.

I request you to kindly consider my health issue and grant me attendance for three weeks. I promise to be regular from now onwards.

Your sincerely
Mukul Baghel
