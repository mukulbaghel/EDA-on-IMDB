Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

IMDB is a popular website for rating films and series. We always go there if we want to watch something new, and many users trust its rankings. The data is about the most famous 6k+ Films and series on IMDB with rates. The Data is Perfect for Exploratory Data Analysis. We can get this data from Kaggle.

Now we will do EDA to find answers to some interesting questions. For that we will import Pandas and NumPy for data storage and processing, and for visualization, we use Matplotlib and Seaborn.
